        Happy sweet sixteen, pretty.  
        I don’t know how to make this sound simple, so I won’t try.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sixteen sounds soft, but you aren’t fragile.  
        You’ve lived through things most people never talk about,  
        and somehow you’re still kind, still gentle, still you.
      </p>

      <p>
        This year was heavy. I know there were days you woke up tired already,  
        nights where you had to be your own comfort.  
        And yet, you kept going. Quietly. Bravely.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m so proud of you.  
        Not just for surviving, but for staying warm in a world that tried to harden you.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re going to be an incredible psychologist someday.  
        You listen with your whole heart. You make people feel seen.  
        That’s not something you learn. That’s who you are.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please remember this, okay?  
        You don’t have to be strong all the time.  
        You don’t have to carry everything alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m here.  
        On the easy days, and the quiet hard ones too.  
        No pressure. No conditions. Just here.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are loved. Deeply. Softly. Truly.
      </p>
